# Notes 09: Cloud Architecture
## Questions
# 1. Summarize a few key points made in the readings or videos.
* Some key points that were made during the readings were RAM, Hard Drives, Optical Drive, and flash drives, Another keypoint that was made was how data can be stored in multiple drives.
# 2. Identify and provide two quotes that were made in the readings or videos, that you found interesting. Describe why you found each quote of them interesting.
* "In terms of data, replicated data is written to multiple hard drives possibly in multiple locations." this quote was interesting to me as Id never knew that data is written onto multiple locations, as data being stored in multiple hard drives was something I somewhat knew about.
* "With cloud storage, there is no hardware to purchase, storage to provision, or capital being used for "someday" scenarios." this quote was interesting to me as why does cloud storage not require a hardware?, as does it still not need a hardware to store it within the internet.
# 3. Outline the new facts that you learned from this section.
*Some new facts that I learned was how data is written in multiple locations and possibly in multiple locations,
# 4. What questions remain in your mind after reading this section?
* is there a way to make cloud storage safe? if there is a way to make cloud storage safe, will it improve in the near future?
